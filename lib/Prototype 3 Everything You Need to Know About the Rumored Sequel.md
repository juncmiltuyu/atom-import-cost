## What is the storyline of Prototype 3?
 
The storyline of Prototype 3 is still a mystery, as there has been no official confirmation or announcement from the developers or publishers. However, based on the previous games and some fan theories, we can make some educated guesses.
 
The first game, Prototype, introduced us to Alex Mercer, a former genetic engineer who was infected by a mysterious virus that gave him shapeshifting abilities. He used his powers to uncover the truth behind his infection and stop a conspiracy involving a biotech corporation called Gentek and a military faction called Blackwatch.
 
The second game, Prototype 2, followed James Heller, a former soldier who was also infected by the virus and sought revenge against Alex Mercer, whom he blamed for the death of his family. He eventually learned that Mercer was not the enemy, but rather a victim of another conspiracy involving Gentek and Blackwatch. He also discovered that Mercer had created a new strain of the virus called Blacklight, which he planned to use to create a new world order.
 
The possible storyline of Prototype 3 could continue from where Prototype 2 left off. It could feature Alex Mercer as the main protagonist again, as he tries to redeem himself and stop Blackwatch from unleashing a new threat. It could also introduce new characters and factions, such as other infected individuals or groups who have their own agendas and motives. It could also explore more of the origins and secrets of the virus and its effects on humanity.
