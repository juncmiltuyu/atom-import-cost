# Death - Leprosy (1988) Review
 
Death is one of the most influential bands in the history of death metal, and their second album, Leprosy, is a classic of the genre. Released in 1988 by Combat Records, Leprosy showcases the band's evolution from their raw and thrashy debut, Scream Bloody Gore, to a more refined and technical style. The album is also notable for being the first example of Scott Burns' production work, which would become a trademark of many death metal and grindcore albums of that era.
